1. Finish the Spidersac tutorial.

2. Tweak/hack the Spidersac Tool to create a new tool, designed for subterranean architectures. 

Example ideas: Utilizing the Solid Union / Difference / Intersection components, modify the tool to design a series of subterranean architecture, semi-sunken into the earth.  Add different types of layers and logic to generate passageways between buildings/facilities, linked together by passages. 

In your editing process, make sure that you are changing at least one aspect of the form-generation process and one aspect of the representational mode that changes how the tool ‘feels’. 

The goal is not to design a project, but to play around and understand the limits of the tool you have created.

3. Make *metrics*:

Focus on the constraints, and create written metrics that accurately respresent the constraints of your tool. 

Often times, these metrics will arise out of the desires of the tool. “What you want to happen with the tool” needs to be translated into “How can you measure the degree to which your goal happened?”

For example, the desire for an electric dog fence may be to “keep dogs inside a fence”, which may translate into a metric of “distance from dog to polyline”.

The desire for the 1916 zoning principle may be to “increase amount of sun exposure on buildings and streets”, which may translates into a metric of “amount of volume violating the setback rule”. 

4. Create visual/representational feedback for these metrics:

Given these metrics, modify and implement the previous assignment’s tool within Grasshopper to represent this feedback to the user using the methods discussed in class.

5. Share

Post the analysis/screenshots on the Tumblr, along with a link to your *.GHX and *.3DM files: http://gsappmetatool-fall15.tumblr.com
