### Assignment 1: Tools for the Subterranean: (Due Sep 29)


**1. Finish the Spidersac tutorial.**

**2. Tweak/hack the Spidersac Tool to create a new tool, designed for subterranean architectures. **

Example ideas: Utilizing the Solid Union / Difference / Intersection components, modify the tool to design a series of subterranean architecture, semi-sunken into the earth.  Add different types of layers and logic to generate passageways between buildings/facilities, linked together by passages. 

In your editing process, make sure that you are changing at least one aspect of the form-generation process and one aspect of the representational mode that changes how the tool ‘feels’. 

**3. Make *metrics*:**

Keeping the idea of a subterranean building tool in mind, create metrics that accurately respresent the constraints of your tool. These metrics will arise out of the desires of the tool. For the tool, what kind of design decisions are okay? What are not okay? Which design decisions do you want to discourage, or encourage? 

For example, you may wish that your building, like an ant hill, is formulated like a series of volumes connected by long passageways. If you would like to discourage the user from placing volumes too close to each other, you can start creating a metric that is the shortest distance from one volume to all the other volumes, and color/represent 'bad' volumes according to this metric.

The desire for an electric dog fence may be to “keep dogs inside a fence”, which may translate into a metric of “keep at least X distance from dog to polyline”. To borrow this principle, you may wish that your building is designed in two steps: the first step, with a circulatory skeleton (on a Rhino layer); the second step, by placing volumes upon or around this skeleton that cannot be too far away. The metric would be: "stay within at least X distance from volume to polyline."


**4. Create visual/representational feedback for these metrics:**

Given these metrics, modify and implement the previous assignment’s tool within Grasshopper to represent this feedback to the user using the methods discussed in class. Do discouraged elements turn red? Do they simply disappear? Do encouraged elements change color, or shape, or size?

**5. Share**

Post the analysis/screenshots on the Tumblr, along with a link to your *.GHX and *.3DM files: http://gsappmetatool-fall15.tumblr.com
